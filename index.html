            <h2>Team Picks and Player Categories</h2>
            <p>The Lahore Qalandars are set to make the first pick in the high-profile Platinum category, followed by Karachi Kings and Quetta Gladiators.

            <h2>Draft Dynamics and Global Influence</h2>
            <p>The PSL draft rules permit teams to retain standout players from the previous season, while also allowing for the inclusion of new talent through multiple rounds of picks per category. This system offers teams a chance to re-strategize by potentially re-selecting players they had previously dropped. In addition to local talents, teams are eagerly signing foreign players, enhancing the league's competitiveness and international appeal.</p>

            <p>In the Marquee category, salaries range from $350,000 to $400,000, attracting globally recognized cricket stars and boosting the PSL's prestige. This draft follows the financial contours set by previous auctions, with each category from Platinum down to Emerging dictating the salary and status of the players. Interestingly, teams have shown a preference for a cost-effective drafting method over direct expensive signings, especially in light of the financial strategies influencing team decisions post-IPL auction.</p>
